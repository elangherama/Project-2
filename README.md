# Project-2:Retail_Sales_Analysis
In this project, I am still using Excel and Looker Studio to enhance my skills. The dataset I am working with is retail sales data.

## Project Objective
Analyze sales trends based on product categories, customer demographics, and purchasing patterns to identify revenue growth opportunities and develop more effective marketing strategies.

## Dataset Used
<a href="https://github.com/elangherama/Project-2/blob/main/retail_sales_dataset.csv">Dataset<a/>

## Questions
- What is the distribution of customers based on age?
- Which products are most frequently purchased based on gender?
- Are there any seasonal or monthly purchasing patterns?
- Which product category has the highest total sales?
- What is the average transaction value per customer?

## Process
1. Data Collection
   - The dataset was obtained from Kaggle.
2. Data Cleaning
   - Used the "Text to Columns" feature to separate data into appropriate columns.
   - Applied MAX, MIN, and COUNTIF functions to validate data, remove duplicates, and ensure no blank entries.
   - Used a Box and Whisker Chart to detect outliers in the dataset.
3. Data Processing
   - Conducted data analysis using Pivot Tables in Excel and partially in Looker Studio.
4. Data Visualization
   - The analysis results were visualized using Looker Studio to gain better insights.

## Project Insight
- The majority of customers fall within the 26-55 age range, with the highest dominance in the 46-55 age group (22.9%).
- Female customers exhibit a more balanced purchasing pattern across Clothing and Electronics, whereas Male customers are more dominant in Clothing purchases.
- The Beauty category is primarily purchased by Female customers, indicating an opportunity for targeted marketing strategies.
- Significant sales spikes occurred in February, May, and July 2023, likely influenced by seasonal trends or promotional campaigns.
- Electronics recorded the highest revenue ($156,905), but Clothing ($155,580) is closely following, demonstrating strong market potential for both categories.
- The average transaction value per customer is $456.00, with most customers falling under the Bronze category (701 customers).
- Customer classification based on total transaction value is as follows:
  1. Gold: Customers with a total amount of over $1,000 per transaction.
  2. Silver: Customers with a total amount between $501 - $999 per transaction.
  3. Bronze: Customers with a total amount below $500 per transaction.

## Final Conclusion and Recommendations
- Encourage Bronze customers to move to Silver by implementing tiered discounts, bundle deals, and referral programs.
- Upgrade Silver customers to Gold through loyalty programs, installment plans, and upselling high-value products.
- Retain Gold customers by offering VIP memberships, exclusive offers, and a subscription model to enhance customer lifetime value.
- Optimize the Electronics & Clothing categories by implementing premium bundling, strategic seasonal campaigns, and targeted promotions.
- Leverage peak sales seasons (February, May, and July) to maximize transactions and execute upselling strategies effectively.
